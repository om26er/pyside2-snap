# PySide2 Snap Runtime for Linux

Qt is very powerful, PySide (Qt for Linux) brings that power to Python.
This snap makes it easy for anyone wanting to ship a PySide based
app to Linux users by bundling all Qt/PySide dependencies.

With pyside2 snap installed, I was able to create a 'Hello World' pyside based
snap with the size of just 8Kb.

The runtime is published to the Snap store: https://snapcraft.io/pyside2

The hello world example that makes use of this snap can be found here: https://github.com/om26er/pyside2-hello-world
